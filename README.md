Hey bud, to run this code, all you have to do is download the folder, then in google chrome or another browser, type in the filepath
to where index.html is saved on your computer. For example, on my linux machine I type in "/home/eric/Documents/javascript_project_three/index.html" and it will
open up a webpage where you can see the code in action. Then you can open up the files in the folder in a text editor like sublime and see how it works.
The only file you probably care about is index.js which is a javascript file containing all the logic you were asking about. I notated it all at the bottom
but let me know if you have any questions.

I also included a .py file that is much more basic but non-visual. If you want to run it you have to have python installed and open up powershell or cmd prompt
and run python tyler_ex.py

Otherwise you can just open up the .py in sublime and take a look at how it works. It's also notated for your benefit.
